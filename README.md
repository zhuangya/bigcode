# The BIG CODE

The title is steal from book <Write Great Code >
This book is trying to tell experienced programming inner things of code, and make programmers code and design better.

All things for Practical use.
In this project, I am trying to show things inside common algorithms, why and how to apply it in our daily jobs. So I choose this [Algorithms(4th)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/032157351X/) as the refer/textbook.

These lecture will last about 10 weeks. (3-5 hours workload/week)
In these lectures we would have some source code.
And we really advant you to join us to have these big code imagine.

## Things inside this class

1.  Engineering plays an important role. refer many things from this, thisand this.

2.  Huge amount of source codes, many things from open source project.

3.  Some Best Practice.

4.  Programming language is not limited.(but I am a heavy python user.)
